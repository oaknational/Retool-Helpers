UNIT-SGIOY-CO142	Non-fiction: changing views	LESS-KWIUU-M1497	Writing a comparison of attitudes	I can write a comparison of attitudes.	In the introduction, make reference to the writers’ over-arching messages and the shifts or consistency of their tone.	Use the first paragraph of analysis to compare how the writers establish their ideas in the opening.	Use the middle paragraph to compare how the writers’ attitude/tone shifts and the exploration of structural features.	Use your final paragraph to compare the final messages that the writers convey on the topic through devices.		overarching	something so important it affects all other areas- in English, we refer to a writer’s overarching idea	shift	when applied to writing, this refers to a change in the writer’s perspective	imperative	a form of a verb which is a direct command or order	connotations	the words, ideas, feelings or concepts we associate with a word or symbol			Beginning a comparison	Continuing a comparison													I must always identify language devices.	Although it is useful to analyse language devices used by a writer, analysing individual words can be just as effective. For example, there are lots of words that could form the basis of good analysis in Day’s article (”devastation", "disaster").	Students will need to have read both of the extracts in this lesson. You will need to spend some time reading if they haven’t previously encountered them.	
UNIT-SGIOY-CO142	Non-fiction: changing views	LESS-KGCLE-H1498	Crafting a voice in nonfiction writing	I can use voice effectively in non-fiction writing.	Take a clear stance for or against the statement - alternative arguments should be refuted at least once in the piece.	Contrast creates a robust sense of a writer’s perspective, by demonstrating feeling towards all angles of an argument.	Use sarcasm to point out the flaws of the opposition, in an emotive and personalised way.	Carefully sequence and vary subtle and dramatic shifts in tone, to draw reactions from the reader.		voice	the a language a writer uses to communicate their perspective- this could be sarcastic, hopeful or fun etc.	sarcasm	the use of irony to show contempt for something: in an opinion piece we can use sarcasm to deal with opposing views	refute	to prove something wrong or untrue	blight	something that spoils something or has a very bad effect	contrast	a rhetorical device used to emphasise the difference between two things	Crafting voice	Refuting counter-arguments			Smoking or alcohol use					Sensitive content					Refuting counter-arguments is enough to create an impact.	Although it is good practice to refute counter-arguments, we can also use language devices when we do so to make these even more powerful.	This lesson focuses on writing an opinion piece about fairs and festivals. You may wish to change the question stem so that it better fits the needs or context of your class.	
UNIT-SGIOY-CO142	Non-fiction: changing views	LESS-OTXSC-R1499	Crafting a clear point of view in non-fiction writing	I can write a letter in which I express a clear point of view.	The status of the recipient defined in the question will indicate the level of formality required in the writing.	Take a clear stance for or against the statement; alternative arguments should be refuted at least once in the piece.	Identifying the recipient offers the opportunity to refer to their role, involvement and action that they could take.	Discourse markers provide useful influential language around your opinion.		refute	to prove something wrong or untrue	discourse markers	words and phrases that help signpost our ideas (e.g. firstly or for example)	formal register	a type of language that is used for important or official pieces of writing	voice	the language a writer uses to communicate their perspective, this could be sarcastic, hopeful or fun etc.	blight	something that spoils something or has a bad effect	Understanding our audience	Discourse markers for counter-arguments													All discourse markers are broadly similar.	Discourse markers are actually very diverse with a whole range of different uses. This lesson focuses explicitly on those appropriate for refuting counter-arguments.	This lesson contains a transactional writing task related to whether fairs and festivals should be banned. You could change this with a different task more appropriate to the needs of your class. The lesson’s tasks and activities would still be appropriate.	
UNIT-SGIOY-CO142	Non-fiction: changing views	LESS-MTLAN-E1496	Structuring a comparison of attitudes	I can precisely structure a comparison of attitudes.	Make three linked points about the writer’s attitudes or perspectives, supported by a range of evidence from both texts.	Contextual information can give a greater understanding of a writer’s perspective.	Use adjectives to track changes in the writers’ perspectives from the start to the end of the text.	Correlative conjunctions and comparatives can be used to write comparative topic sentences.		perspective	the way someone thinks or feels about a particular thing	context	background information that can help us understand a text further (e.g. when it was written)	shift	when applied to writing, this refers to a change in the writer’s perspective	correlative conjunctions	correlative conjunctions work in pairs to join words, phrases or clauses (e.g. neither/nor)	comparative conjunctions	comparative conjunctions are used to show a difference between two ideas (e.g. ‘whereas’ )	Identifying a writer’s perspective	Comparing writers’ attitudes													As long as I use adjectives to qualify a writer’s perspective then that is good writing.	Although a good starting point, the best writing will ensure that adjectives are used to evaluate shifts in a writer’s perspective across a piece.	Students will need time to read both of the extracts if they haven’t read them in a previous lesson. 	
UNIT-SGIOY-CO142	Non-fiction: changing views	LESS-RQDUI-B1485	Planning for effective language analysis	I can plan for cohesively written language analysis.	Precise evaluative adjectives express an interpretation in relation to the question.	Define one over-arching point about the way language is used and use three smaller points to support.	Select evidence that explores patterns and contrasts within the language.	Use short judicious quotations of 1-3 words to support analysis.	Create an over-arching sense of the writer’s purpose or underlying message - show how this is conveyed through language.	evaluative adjectives	adjectives we can use in our writing to give a judgement about what we are reading	overarching	something so important it affects all other areas- in English, we refer to a writer’s overarching idea	judicious	showing good judgement- when applied to evidence, it means well-chosen to the point you are making	embedded	when referring to quotes, it means quotes that form part of your own writing	dwarfism	a condition causing someone to have a shorter height as a result of a genetic or medical condition	Reading ’My life as a little person'	Analysing language to explore attitude			Historic or outdated representations of people that may portray inequality or injustice.	legacy content guidance				Sensitive content					Language devices - like similes and metaphors - are more appropriate for analysis in stories and narrative fiction.	Creative non-fiction writing can be rich in methods and language devices - it can offer just as many opportunities for analysis as a more traditionally creative piece.	This lesson is focused on an article written by Cara Reedy - an American journalist who writes about her experiences with dwarfism. You may wish to build context further by exploring further resources (videos/articles) about Reedy and her condition.
